* K-nearest neighbor implementation:
  * The idea is to use the k-neighbor of data to make a prediction of the class.
  * For every test data,  we calculate the euclidean distance between every test data and the training data.
  * For every test data, We choose the k nearest data set and use those k data set to make a classifiction using class vote.
